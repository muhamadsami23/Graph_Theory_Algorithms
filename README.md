# **Graph Theory Algorithms**

This repository contains various implementations of algorithms in Python related to **Graph Theory**. It provides solutions and examples for different types of graphs, including **simple graphs**, **bipartite graphs**, **tripartite graphs**, and more.

## **Contents**

The repository includes Python scripts for the following graph theory concepts and algorithms:

### **1. Simple Graph**
   - *Implementation of algorithms to work with simple graphs (graphs with no self-loops and no multiple edges between nodes).*
   - Example: `simple_graph.py`

### **2. Bipartite Graph**
   - *Algorithms to check whether a graph is bipartite or not.*
   - Example: `bipartite_graph.py`

### **3. Tripartite Graph**
   - *Implementation for checking if a graph can be divided into three disjoint sets such that no two vertices within the same set are adjacent.*
   - Example: `tripartite_graph.py`

### **4. Havel_Hakeimi_Algorithm**
   - *Implementation of Havel Hakeimi Algorithm*
   - Example: Visualization in `havel_hakimi_algorithm.py`

## **Libraries Used**

The following Python libraries are used in this repository:

- **`matplotlib`**: For visualizing graphs and plotting.
- **`networkx`**: For handling and manipulating graph structures.

## **How to Use**

Each Python script in this repository demonstrates an algorithm or property of graph theory.

### **Simple Graph:**
- *The script will prompt you to input the number of vertices and edges.*
- *It will then build a simple graph and display relevant information about it.*

### **Bipartite Graph:**
- *The script will allow you to check if a given graph is bipartite by analyzing the graph structure.*

### **Tripartite Graph:**
- *You can check if a graph is tripartite and explore its properties.*
